"Should I stick with my current tools or upgrade for the new year?" - Jennifer from Seattle

Jennifer, if your current tools are working well, don't change just for the sake of change. But if you're experiencing any of these pain points, it's time to upgrade:

❌ Spending too much time on status updates
❌ Projects falling through the cracks  
❌ Team members confused about priorities
❌ Manual work that could be automated

**Monday.com solves all of these issues** and more.
