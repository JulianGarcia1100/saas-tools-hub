## 🎯 **DECISION POINTS & STRATEGY**

### **Multilingual Expansion: NOT RECOMMENDED YET**
**Reasoning**: English market still has massive untapped potential
**Focus Instead**: Dominate English keywords first, then consider Spanish/German markets

### **Content Strategy: Quality Over Quantity**
**Approach**: Create fewer, higher-quality posts targeting commercial keywords
**Priority**: Commercial intent > informational content

### **Affiliate Strategy: Monday.com Focus**
**Reasoning**: Proven conversion rates and strong commission structure
**Expansion**: Add complementary tools (CRM, email marketing) after Monday.com success
